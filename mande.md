We present a novel Monitoring and Evaluation framework for improving maternal health outcomes by addressing the Three Delays Model. Our approach targets four key outcomes across the maternal healthcare journey. First, we're improving knowledge about maternal health, measured through group attendance and knowledge surveys, with a goal of 75% attendance among pregnant mothers within one year. Second, we're addressing transportation challenges to reduce travel time to facilities by 50% within five years. Third, we're increasing antenatal care uptake through community health worker visits, targeting four visits per pregnancy. Finally, we're working to reduce hospital wait times by up to 75% over 15 years, ensuring mothers receive timely care once they arrive at facilities. Our measurement combines quantitative tracking with qualitative interviews to capture both statistical improvements and mothers' lived experiences. This comprehensive approach allows us to monitor and improve each critical stage of maternal healthcare access, from decision-making through care delivery
